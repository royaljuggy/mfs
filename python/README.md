# Config notes
There should be a `credentials.txt` file of the form:

```
database=...
user=...
host=...
password=...
port=...
```

that you need to create in this directory. It is used in the import_data and drop_table scripts, which allow you to import your own dataset into the schema! The credentials.txt file is used to connect to create a postgres connection.

## Dataset
The dataset is from kaggle. See https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies
