# mfs
mfs - a movie file system

## Libraries Needed
### React
### Python
- psycopg2 `pip install psycopg2-binary` or `pip install psycopg2`
- pandas `pip install pandas`

## Initial Configurations
One-time installations you need to do. Obviously first is installing all required libraries from the above list.

Once you're done that, make sure to create an empty Postgres database for this project. I've named mine 'movie-file-system' and labelled it in my private credentials file used by the import script.

## Running the Application
