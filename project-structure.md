# Programming Notes
Some notes about how I'm structuring this full-stack app

## Front-end
React

## Back-end
Flask (Python)

## Database
Postgres

## Other functionality
Terminal side functionality built into back-end. That is, when running the flask server, you're also able to use the application in the terminal. What's the benefit? Simplicity.
